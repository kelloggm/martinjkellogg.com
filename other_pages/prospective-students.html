     <h1>Working Together on Research</h1>
     <p>
       This page is intended for students who are interested in working together
       on a research project, whether that project is a undergrad independent study,
       master's project or thesis, or a PhD. This page is designed to answer
       four important questions for a prospective student:
       <ul>
	 <li>Why might you (the prospective student) want to do research?</li>
	 <li>What is it like to work with Martin, specifically, on research?</li>
	 <li>What sort of projects might we work together on?</li>
	 <li>What are the concrete steps to start working with Martin?</li>
       </ul>
     </p>

     <b>Why might you want to do research?</b>
     <p>
       Research is the process of discovering things that no one knows. Our goal
       in any research project is to discover something that no one else knew before
       and then tell other people about that new thing. Sometimes the new thing is
       a technique, like a new way to reason about programs. Sometimes the new thing
       is the combination of existing techniques in a surprisingly-effective way.
       Sometimes the new thing is a fact about the world that no one else knew
       before, such as a correlation or causation relationship between two things.
       The key thing in research is <i>novelty</i>: that we discover something that
       was previously unknown to humanity at large.
     </p>

     <p>
       There are lots of good reasons for you to do research. One reason is that
       it is inherently exciting to discover something that no one else knew before:
       the scientist's pure joy of discovery. But, it is equally valid to do research
       for more practical reasons. Research trains your skills in making an effective
       argument, in presenting data in a compelling way, and in reasoning about the
       world around you. Companies like to hire people who are good at research: good
       researchers also typically make good software engineers, data scientists, etc.
       Research in software engineering and programming languages, especially, also
       incidentally trains you in the technical skills that a good software engineer
       has: the technical sophistication to understand unknown code, the ability to
       apply advanced program analysis techniques, etc. After all, it is difficult to
       improve the state of the art in software engineering if you cannot do the state
       of the art first!
     </p>

     <p>
       A common motivation for students is that they want to get a good job
       in the US after they finish their degree. For this reason, it is common
       to focus on "hot" topics (as I write, the "hot" topic is machine learning).
       If your motivation is to find a good job after finishing your degree, I urge
       you to look beyond the hot topics: large companies are struggling to
       staff their verification divisions as much, or more, as their machine learning
       divisions. While the absolute size of the verification teams at companies is
       still usually smaller than their ML teams, there are far fewer qualified
       people: many more people want to do machine learning than want to do verification
       during grad school.
     </p>

     <b>What is it like to work with Martin, specifically, on research?</b>

     <p>
       My research area is at the intersection of the "software engineering" and
       "programming languages" sub-areas of computer science. What that means in
       practice is that I focus on improving the state of the art in <i>usable</i>
       verification technology: that is, making it possible to prove more things
       about a program in a way that is compatible with existing software engineering
       methodologies. This research sub-area is inherently very practical: you should
       expect to be reading and writing large, complex programs. Especially common
       is working directly with the implementation of a compiler, so having a background
       that includes a class on either interpreters or, better, compilers will make your transition
       into research with me a lot easier. You should also expect to be exposed to
       the standard development practices of a good software shop: I expect my students
       to e.g., have their code reviewed (by me or others), write good tests, use hermetic
       build systems, use static analysis and/or verification when appropriate, etc: in
       other words, to act like good software engineers while working for me.
       If you don't feel like you already have these skills, don't worry: I am happy
       to teach them!
     </p>

     <p>
       On the other hand, research in programming languages is typically quite theoretical:
       the usual qualifications for graduate study in the area include a strong background
       in math and the ability to interact with CS theory. Because our research is more
       practical, my students don't need these skills right away; but, a successful student
       will develop them over the time we work together. It is difficult to design your own
       effective analysis without strong theoretical skills, but you can definitely implement
       the designs of others without such skills (others like your friendly neighborhood PL/SE
       professor).

     <p>
       I am early career faculty and that means that I will quite hands-on with students in
       advising style, especially because my academic geneology (i.e., the professors with whom
       I did research during my undergraduate and graduate years) was also made of hands-on advisors,
       even when they were relatively senior. That means I will happily meet with you multiple times a week, write
       code and/or text for your projects, give you code reviews, etc. Not all professors do this
       when working with students: if you'd prefer to be left alone to do work your way, it might
       be hard for us to work together effectively. However, given that most students are just starting
       out in research, I think that a hands-on approach where I am actively involved in your
       work is best for making you as effective a researcher as you can be.
