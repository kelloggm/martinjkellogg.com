I'm giving a talk today at ESEC/FSE in San Fransisco on our paper
["On the Relationship Between Code Verifiability and Understandability"](../papers/esec-fse-2023-preprint.pdf)
(joint work with [Oscar Chaparro](https://ojcchar.github.io/) and his student Kobi Feldman at William and Mary)
in the Empirical Studies I session (at 14:30). [Slides available here](../assets/fse-2023-slides.pdf).
