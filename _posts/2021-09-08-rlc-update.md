We have updated our paper ["Lightweight and Modular Resource Leak Verification"](papers/esec-fse-2021-camera-ready-updated.pdf) to correct a minor error in table 3 (the ablation study, section 7.2) that resulted from an error we discovered in our experimental scripts. None of our scientific conclusions have changed because of this correction, so the paper's text is unchanged. The original version can still be found [here](papers/esec-fse-2021-camera-ready.pdf).
