I'm super excited that our paper ["Static Program Reduction via Type-Directed Slicing"](./papers/issta25-preprint.pdf) will appear at ISSTA this year!
I'm especially proud that this is my first paper without any other senior authors - just my students and I! I think this work has the potential
to be really cool, and I'm excited to continue to build on it. You can also check out the [implementation](https://github.com/njit-jerse/specimin), which
we're still continuing to improve!
