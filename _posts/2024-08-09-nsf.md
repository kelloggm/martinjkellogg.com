I'm thrilled that the NSF has funded my [grant proposal](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2414110) 
with [Oscar Chaparro](https://ojcchar.github.io/) to further investigate the
relationship between when and how verification tools fail to prove that code is correct
and when and how humans struggle to understand code that we discovered in our
[FSE 2023 paper](https://web.njit.edu/~martinjkellogg.com/papers/esec-fse-2023-preprint.pdf).
