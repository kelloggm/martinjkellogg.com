I'm participating in two talks: a [doctoral symposium](papers/doctoral-symposium-paper.pdf) [talk](papers/doctoral-symposium-talk.pdf) at 7am Pacific on Tuesday 8/24 and a joint talk with Narges Shadab of UCR in the main technical track on our paper ["Lightweight and Modular Resource Leak Verification"](papers/esec-fse-2021-camera-ready-updated.pdf), which will show twice: at 6am and 6pm Pacific time on 8/26.
