For my undergraduate thesis at CMU, I'm working on Concurrent C0 with [Frank
Pfenning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/). Concurrent C0 is an extension to the
[C0](http://c0.typesafety.net) that includes session typed message passing.

A draft of [my thesis](/papers/cc0-thesis.pdf) details the design and
implementation of Concurrent C0. I also made a 
[research poster](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d83mdwrau9m9j5h/poster.pdf?raw=1)
for CMU's Meeting of the Minds 2015, though it's a little out of date now.
