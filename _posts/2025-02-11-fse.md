I'm delighted that our paper ["A New Approach to Evaluating Nullability Inference Tools"](../papers/fse25-nullability-comparison-camera-ready.pdf) will appear at FSE this year!
Congratulations to my student [Erfan Arvan](https://web.njit.edu/~ea442/) for his hard work on this paper, and to my
collaborators [Nima Karimipour](https://nimakarimipour.github.io/) and [Manu Sridharan](https://manu.sridharan.net/) at UC Riverside. We couldn't have done
it without you :)
