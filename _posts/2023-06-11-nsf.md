I'm honored that the NSF has funded my [grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2312262&HistoricalAwards=false) 
with [Manu Sridharan](https://manu.sridharan.net/) to work on better
type inference systems for pluggable types. I'm excited to build new inference systems
that will make it easier for developers to apply pluggable typecheckers to their
legacy codebases!
