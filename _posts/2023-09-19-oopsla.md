I'm thrilled that our paper ["Inference of Resource Management Specifications"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11953.pdf) will appear at OOPSLA in October! This is joint work between the original Resource Leak Checker team ([FSE '21](papers/esec-fse-2021-camera-ready-updated.pdf)) and folks at Microsoft Research who have implemented an RLC-inspired system for C#; we joined forces to solve the tricky inference problems that resource leak checking brings up.
