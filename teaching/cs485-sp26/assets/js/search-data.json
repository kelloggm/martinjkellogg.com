    "title": "Grading and Assignments",
    "content": "Your grade is composed of the following sub-scores (in no particular order): . | 50%: Course Project (consisting of 5 sub-assignments, with the final submission worth 30% of the total course grade) | 18%: Reflection Essays | 32%: In-class Activities, Participation, and Professionalism | . This class will be curved: when grading, I prefer to use the whole range available rather than scores in a tight range. That is, if an assignment is worth 10 points, I will give grades at all the points between 0 and 10. I will project your raw scores onto the final distribution once in the middle of the semester; you will be notified of your current projected class grade via email at this point. Programming Projects and Other Assignments . There will be a semester-long course project that will involve a significant software development effort. Students will work in small, self-selected teams. The scale of the project will be intentionally absurd: it will be so much work that no reasonable professor could ask their students to write the code themselves. Instead, students will be expected to use AI models to generate most of the code. The project will involve using LLMs as part of every step of the engineering process, from requirements gathering to coding to testing to deployment. As part of your submission for each assignment, you will be required to submit the logs of all of your interactions with your AI tools. Be sure to keep these logs. TODO: add more details here for students about how to do this to avoid surprises. The course project is broken down into 5 sub-assignments, with the final submission being the largest component. Students will also complete several reflection essays throughout the semester, which are designed to encourage critical thinking about the use of AI in software engineering. These essays must be completed without the assistance of AI tools. Textbook . This course has no required textbook. Students will make heavy use of generative AI tools via APIs, so a subscription to one of them is recommended. In particular, a web-based LLM is not sufficient, because students will be expected to run their LLMs in “agentic” loops, where an automated process (e.g., a test suite) provides feedback to the LLM until some condition is met. Student- or free-tier plans are often available. I expect students will need at least one of Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, etc. Topic-specific reading materials for software engineering topics (e.g., software architecture, various testing techniques, code review, etc.) will be provided; these will be officially optional, but strongly recommended for students who have not taken CS 490. Participation &amp; Professionalism . Your participation &amp; professionalism grade is based on your interactions with the instructors and TAs: in-class, on the course discussion forum, in office hours, etc. Remote Participation . Generally this class does not support remote participation: teaching is much more effective, in my experience, when everyone is physically present. However, I understand that sometimes you are sick, traveling, or otherwise unable to come to class. I will arrange for remote participation in any particular lecture as long as you request it at least one hour in advance (if you’re sick or in some other emergency) or 24 hours in advance (if you’re traveling or otherwise planning to be unable to come to class). Notify the instructor via email if you need to participate in a particular class remotely. Asking Questions . There is a course Discord server which you can use to ask (and answer) questions about any of the course topics or for help with the homework. Participating on Discord is optional, but if you do participate in a productive manner (especially by answering other student’s questions!), it will have a positive impact on your participation score. Exams . This course does not have traditional exams. Your understanding will be assessed through your project work, reflection essays, and in-class participation. ",

    "title": "Collaboration Policy",
    "content": "Collaboration is generally encouraged in this course, as is consulting online resources. You are permitted to copy small amounts of code from any source except someone else’s copy of an assignment, as long as you cite your source. “someone else’s copy of an assignment” also includes students not currently enrolled in the course - e.g., students who took this class in previous semesters or took classes that used similar projects at other institutions. To make this more clear, here are some examples of acceptable and unacceptable collaboration on a programming assignment in this course: . Acceptable collaborations: . | Discuss problems/solutions/anything with any number of other students (as long as you don’t look at each other’s code). | Copy a short (about 10 lines or fewer - use your judgment) snippet from stackoverflow.com or a similar source, as long as you include a comment with the source URL. | Copy code written by one of your teammates during a group project for another part of the group project. | Copy code from the output of a generative AI tool such as ChatGPT that you prompted yourself, if you include a link to a record of your interaction with the model (e.g., ChatGPT’s “share” feature) as a code comment. | . Unacceptable collaborations: . | Copy code directly from another student on an individual project. | Copy code from another group on a group project. | Copy a significant portion (more than about 10 lines of code or a single method - use your judgment) of your assignment from the internet, even if you cite your source. | Copy a short snippet from the internet without citing your source. | Copy code from the output of a generative AI tool (such as ChatGPT) without citing your source | Copy code from the output of a generative AI tool prompted by someone other than you (or your teammates, for a group project) | . These rules are intended to mimic what is acceptable in industry when working as a software engineer: using the resources available to you, such as your teammates and the wider internet, is always allowed. But, it would be illegal to copy code from a competing company working on a similar product. Generative AI Policy . You are permitted to use generative AI tools on any assignment in this course, as long as you include a record of your interaction with the generative AI tool in your submission. For example, if you use ChatGPT to help you with an assignment, you are required to include the output of the “share” tool in OpenAI’s interface as a code comment in your submission. You may choose how you include your prompts and responses in your submission (e.g., it’s also permissible to include the full text of both your prompts and the output of the tool), but the following must be accessible to the course staff while grading: . | the name and version of the model being used | the full text of your prompts | the full text of the model’s responses | . TODO: update this and the collaboration policy to match the expectation that AI tools will be used for all assignments and that students will include a full, replayable log of their interactions with the AI as part of their assignment submission. Consequences of Violating the Collaboration Policy . (From the University) . “Academic Integrity is the cornerstone of higher education and is central to the ideals of this course and the university. Cheating is strictly prohibited and devalues the degree that you are working on. As a member of the NJIT community, it is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the academic code of integrity policy that is found at: http://www5.njit.edu/policies/sites/policies/files/academic-integrity-code.pdf. Please note that it is my professional obligation and responsibility to report any academic misconduct to the Dean of Students Office. Any student found in violation of the code by cheating, plagiarizing or using any online software inappropriately will result in disciplinary action. This may include a failing grade of F, and/or suspension or dismissal from the university. If you have any questions about the code of Academic Integrity, please contact the Dean of Students Office at dos@njit.edu” . ",

The final project submission may not be submitted late, because it is due on the same day as the final exam. After that point, the course is over and I will be computing final grades.

    "title": "What is a research paper?",
    "content": "In computer science, original research is typically published at peer-reviewed conferences. Typically these papers have between two and ten authors, and the paper typically reports on about a person-year’s worth of work (though this can vary widely). The authors will be a mix of junior and senior researchers: anyone who contributed something “intellectually significant” to the paper is typically listed as an author. In most CS sub-disciplines (including software engineering, which is the source for most of the “Optional” readings), author order is indicative: the first author is usually the person who did most of the technical work (e.g., implementing the tool, running the experiments, etc.), and the last author is typically the project leader (often, but not always, the first author’s research advisor). Often, but not always, the first author is a PhD student. To be accepted at a peer-reviewed conference, a research paper must be novel: that is, it must contain some new knowledge or evidence that the research community wasn’t aware of before. This requirement impacts how they are written: a research paper must focus on the specific thing that is novel about it, rather than surveying the field as a whole (though you can find “survey” papers that give an overview of a research area, and if you need to know the current state of a sub-field, looking for a survey paper is the way to go).

Unfortunately, docker will not suffice here (but experience with it will help you): follow the instructions below. | Some students already have other versions of Ubuntu installed. Everything will probably work fine on these other versions, but again if you run into trouble you should follow these instructions. | . | Option 2: Cloud: Set up an Amazon EC2 cloud instance with Ubuntu 22.04 running on it. This option will work if you have a slower or older computer. Start early; Amazon takes up to 24 hours to verify cloud computing accounts. This option involves more of a command-line interface but typically runs some course tools a bit faster than local machine. | . Both options should work with all assignments in this course. Option 1 (local VM) will have you install VirtualBox on your computer, download an Ubuntu 22.04 installation image, and install x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 in your virtual machine. A reasonably modern computer (e.g., at most 5 years old) should be able to run a VM guest without issue. However, some students report that the VM executes too slowly (e.g., the mouse is laggy, keystrokes are missed, programs take too long, etc.). If your VM guest is too slow, you can consider using Option 2 instead (see below). First, you may want to read the summary of virtual machines and cloud computing below. Even if you are familiar with the concepts from previous experiences, this course may use slightly different terminology, and I recommend that you skim the material (click on the box below to see the background material). Background: Virtual Machines and Cloud Computing A Virtual Machine is an emulation of a computer system. Loosely, you can think of a VM as a program that can run an entire virtual computer system. Virtual machines are powerful software systems that enable running software designed for one operating system inside another operating system. For example, you can use your Windows host computer to run a Virtual Machine that contains a Linux operating system. Consider the image below: . This is a Windows 10 host_computer running three different Virtual Machine _guests. The guest instances are complete (virtual) environments that are isolated from the host. All of the guests share the host’s hardware as they execute — each window in the screenshot above lets you interact with a separate emulated guest. Thus, even though the host is a Windows computer, you can use one of the guests to execute Linux software inside the guest. Virtual Machines can be used in many combinations. You can have a Windows, Linux, or Mac host computer, and run arbitary numbers and combinations of Linux and Windows guests. Finally, guests are stored as files in the host computer — this means you can move your VM guest from one host to another by transferring that file around. Option 1 (“Local”): You can choose to set up and run your own Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine locally. This will allow you complete all of the assignments in this course within that virtual machine. However, some students report that the VM guest runs too slowly (especially if you do not have enough RAM in your computer). If you find that a local VM is too slow, you can use Option 2 instead. Virtual machines are a critical part of Cloud computing. You can “rent out” computing resources from a provider like Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure to do whatever computation you might need. Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure both offer you virtual machine guests that run on their hardware. Thus, you can get access to a virtual machine running whatever operating system you like to run a variety of software. Option 2 (“Cloud”): If you find that a local VM is too slow, you can instead get a free Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine from Amazon EC2 (or any other cloud computing provider, but this specification walks you through how to do it on EC2). Amazon EC2 (“Elastic Cloud Compute”) is a service that lets you buy and configure virtual machines. Option 2 has you setup and launch an Ubuntu 22.04 cloud instance (this is free if you are a student). Many of the assignments are easier to complete on Linux or similar command-line systems. If you’re not comfortable with such systems, the background tab below on Linux Fundamentals might be useful: . Background: Linux Fundamentals Vanderbilt professor Kevin Leach has prepared a (long) video that provides a gentle introduction to a number of Linux concepts that are relevant to this course. This video is optional, but you may find it useful if you are less familiar with the Linux environment. There are timestamps in a comment below the video that contain points of interest, such as: . | terminals | environment variables | scripts in the shell | compiling programs from source | using ssh | . The first half is more about terminals and shells (why do we have to type ./a.out? why can’t we just say a.out?), and the second half is more about compiling programs from source. The video also covers elinks in particular, which is a terminal-based browser program (using elinks is not required for this course, but it might be helpful if you choose to use a cloud computer and need to access the web to e.g., submit an assignment).

If your CPU does not support virtualization extensions, then your VM may run slowly. If that’s the case, consider Option 2 for this assignment instead. You will need: . | A copy of VirtualBox for your operating system. General download link (look under “Platform Package” or similar). | A copy of 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 (Download — 64-bit is required here: don’t use 32-bit). This is a large .iso file that might take a long time to download. You don’t need it until part way through the installation process, but you should start the download now. | When something goes wrong during this installation, we recommend that you search this webpage and also look for previous posts on the forum. Some solutions may be listed a little lower on the webpage than when you encounter them. Macs typically give students many more issues than Windows machines, so if you are a student using a Mac, looking to see if the issue is already addressed can be a big time saver. | . VirtualBox . VirtualBox is a Virtual Machine Manager. You install VirtualBox on your host computer (i.e., as a regular program or app). Then, you use VirtualBox to create a virtual machine guest. Once you have created a guest, you install Ubuntu 22.04 inside of the guest. Then, you can start the guest and have a complete Ubuntu 22.04 environment within that guest. Isolation in Virtual Machine Guests Note well: Implicit here is that the guest is, to some extent, isolated from the host. This is very important and entails a number of conceptual hurdles if you are not used to virtualization: . | The clipboard is isolated. That is, if you copy something from your host environment, you cannot paste it inside the guest environment. This is because the VM guest is a completely independent operating system environment from your host. | Typing and mouse movements have to be captured by the guest. | If you want to download a file to use in the guest, you must do so from the guest environment. Unless you set up a shared drive (which is not required), you have to download or create files within the guest environment rather than the host environment. | . Installing VirtualBox . You can install VirtualBox with the default settings. For your reference, screenshots of the course staff completing the installation are shown below: . If you receive a “The installation failed.” message on a Mac, you can resolve the issue by going to Security and Privacy and allowing the installation. ",

Remember downloading a large .iso file as indicated above when we discussed downloading Ubuntu (if you missed it, you should go back and download it now)? This is a Disk Image — we need to attach the OS Disk Image into the VM. On the VM Management window, right click the VM you just created, and click “Settings”: . Next, click on “Storage”, then click on the “Empty IDE Controller” (your version of VirtualBox may call this a CD drive, Optical storage drive, or similar. Regardless, you should be able to select a virtual disk image). Click the Disk icon, then click “Choose disk file…”: . Then, select the Ubuntu .iso file you downloaded earlier. This places the Ubuntu 22.04 installation medium in the VM’s disk drive. Click OK, and you are now ready to start your VM from the Manager (note: the image below is from a previous version of the course that used Ubuntu 16.04 instead of Ubuntu 22.04. When you do this, your .iso file must be for Ubuntu 22.04.): . If you receive a “Kernel driver not installed” error, follow these instructions online for how to resolve the issue. (The image below shows the “Kernel driver not installed” error, for your reference.) . The Virtual Machine will now boot and load the Ubuntu 22.04 installation. The VM opens in a new window — you can think of this window as the virtual “screen” that lets you see what’s happening in the emulated system. You can follow through the normal Ubuntu 22.04 installation: . Note: If the VM asks you to select a startup disk, you need only select your .iso file. You want the VM to boot from the installation media so you can install Ubuntu within the guest. We recommend opting to install updates and third-party software. It should not affect the system one way or another: . You can select “Erase disk and install Ubuntu”. This is only referring to erasing the “virtual” disk you created earlier with the VM. If you are receiving an error like the “following disc images couldn’t be opened for the reason of no mountable file systems”, you may be able to resolve the issue by following recommendations online . Note: Sometimes during installation, students find that a window is too large to display all the buttons. You can actually move the window like normal to reveal the Continue button (just click to drag the window like any other — the window inside the Virtual Machine, not the Virtual Machine itself): . Next, it will ask you to create an account for logging in. You can put whatever credentials you like here — it will not have any bearing on your host computer. This is merely for an account on the guest VM. Just make sure you don’t forget whatever password you choose! . Next, you just wait a bit for the OS to install inside the guest. It might take a few minutes to complete. Eventually, you’ll see a screen asking you to remove installaton media and restart. You can just click restart (on the guest) and you’ll be all set! . Virtual Machines and Mice While you’re running the VM, you may find that it “takes control” of your mouse and keyboard, and you aren’t able to leave the window. If this happens, press CTRL+ALT to release control from the VM window. (The keystrokes may be different on Mac OS). ",

Amazon AWS accounts can take up to 24 hours to verify, which means you may have to wait before you can use it for an assignment or demo. Start early! . You will need a Secure Shell (SSH) client. SSH allows you to remotely interact with a server. (If you’ve never used SSH before, scrolling back up the page and watching the appropriate section of the “Linux Fundamentals” video might help.) When you SSH to a remote computer, you have access to a command prompt that runs software on that computer. We will be using SSH to interact with a virtual machine we create in the cloud with Amazon EC2. On Windows, I recommend using WSL to run SSH. You can also use PuTTY. On Mac, you should already have ssh installed. Open a terminal and you can run ssh. On Linux, you can use ssh, but you may need to install it first (e.g., sudo apt-get install openssh or similar, depending on your platform). It is your responsibility to understand how to use SSH, though we give some pointers below. Amazon EC2 is a cloud computing service that allows you to rent virtual machines that you can ssh to and run programs like any other computer. Amazon offers a large number of cloud-based services all under the umbrella of AWS (Amazon Web Services). EC2 is a subset of AWS. In this section, you will create an AWS account to manage EC2 virtual machines. You can sign up for a new account on Amazon EC2, and in doing so, you get 12 months of free access to a virtual machine that is enough to complete the assignments in this course. If you do not already have an Amazon EC2 account, navigate to https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ and click “Create new account” in the upper right. Complete the sign up process. You may be prompted for credit card information, however you should not be charged as long as you create only one virtual machine on the free tier. You then will have access to the Amazon AWS Console. If you are prompted, you want to sign in as a “Root” user for the AWS console. AWS Account Creation Note that it can take 24 hours for Amazon to verify your account. We believe this is because they manually review account creation — after all, they are giving you access to computing resources. Since cloud services are easily abused (e.g., for spam emails, command and control virus management, and distributed denial of service attacks), Amazon applies a bit of scrutiny to AWS users. Start early! . Notice: AWS Web GUI Changes Some of the screenshots in this guide are from older versions of the AWS Web Interface. The GUI changes fairly frequently and so your view may look a little different from the screenshots. Everything is fine and it’s good practice to follow along with documentation that is not an exact match. The course staff verified that the instructions work and pass the HW0 autograder most recently on 8/27/2022. If you believe you’ve discovered a problematic difference between this guide and the current version of the AWS GUI, contact your TA. Creating a New VM . Now that you have created an account, you can use the AWS Console to help manage and launch virtual machine instances. We will walk you through the steps to create an Ubuntu 22.04 VM below. (1) Open the AWS Console . After you create an AWS account, you can visit the AWS Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com. At the console, you should be greeted with a large screen full of many services. See highlight on left: . Click here to see AWS Console screenshot . (2) Open the EC2 Manager . From the AWS Console, click the “EC2” link to open the Elastic Cloud Compute manager. The EC2 Manager lets you manage and launch Instances, which are virtual machines that you configure. The first thing we need to do is configure and launch a new instance. Click the Launch Instance button. Click here to see EC2 Manager screenshot . (3) Choose an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Instance . This is the most important step. You must select an Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type instance. This is a free tier eligible instance that contains an environment suitable for completing the rest of the assignments. Don’t pick other versions of Ubuntu (NOT 18.04 or 20.04, etc.). The autograder uses Ubuntu 22.04 (in an AWS VM!), so if you want the smoothest experience, use that version. As of 1/12/2023, the correct image is the default for Ubuntu: . Click here to see screenshot of the instructor selecting the correct VM image . After that you can fill out the rest of the selection (e.g., making certain to select your key pair for that instance) and then verify that it is in the Free Tier. Click here for \"free tier\" screenshot . (4) Configure Your Instance . After you select the image to launch, it may ask you a few questions about storage (pick the default if so). Usually, it will skip ahead and ask you about instance details. You want to pick the free version, called a t2.micro instance. If you were using cloud computing for a business or another project, you could configure resources like (a) how many CPUs, (b) how much RAM, and (c) what type of storage you get on the VM. For this course, just pick “t2.micro” to get the free level. Click here for instance type selection screenshot . (5) Configure Authentication . After you set up your instance, you need to create a way to login. This is a tricky security problem because Amazon wants to give you root (Administrator) access to your new instance. The way they do this is by using asymmetric key encryption. Basically, Amazon will let you download a file that serves as your credentials. Rather than entering a password, you will provide this special file to let you login. If you’d like to learn more about asymmetric key encryption, take a security course. Now, you will be prompted to set up credentials for logging in. Select Create a new key pair and type in any name (the examples use “eecs481” in the screenshots below). (If you are given a key type option, like “RSA” vs. “ED22519”, pick “RSA”.) Then, click Download Key Pair. It is imperative that you keep this file in a secure location. Do not upload it to GitHub, do not move it around. This is basically like a password for accessing your instance — you wouldn’t want someone malicious to access your instance and do something bad with it (you would be legally responsible for whatever they did!). Click here for keypair creation screenshot . Once you had downloaded your Key Pair, you should be able to Launch your instance. Do so and continue. There is a screenshot below showing what you should see after launching your instance. Click here for launch confirmation screenshot . (6) Connect to Your Instance . At this point, you have set up an Ubuntu 22.04 instance on EC2 and created associated credentials. You now have a virtual machine running in the cloud that you can connect to. You will use ssh to connect to your instance. This is the recommended way — you could technically install a front-end and use remote desktop software, however we strongly recommend using the command line, since you will be using the CLI in many of the course assignments. From the EC2 Management Dashboard, right-click your running instance. You should see a menu pop up like below: . Click “Connect”. It will pop up a window giving you a number of options. Pick the “SSH Client” tab to see how to connect via ssh: . On this window, you will see the hostname of your EC2 instance to which you can ssh, as well as a number of instructions for connecting. Mac permissions errors Some students, especially those using Mac computers, report receiving permission errors when they try to SSH into their EC2 instances: . In this case, a command like . chmod go-rwx /path/to/eecs481.pem . usually resolves the issue. More information is available online about this SSH issue. Using Windows WSL to SSH to EC2 If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to connect to your Amazon EC2 instance, you must prepare your key file before connecting. Our recommendation is to run the following (but use your path): . mkdir -p ~/.ssh/ cp /path/to/your/downloaded/eecs481.pem ~/.ssh chmod 400 ~/.ssh/eecs481.pem . Windows WSL does not apply Linux file permissions correctly unless you are dealing with files contained within the Linux FS. Moving your key to ~/.ssh/ will allow you to chmod 400 appropriately. The SSH client will not allow you to connect to any server using that key if it does not have the correct permissions. Recall you downloaded a .pem file when you set up authentication for your instance (see part 5 above). You must specify this file on your SSH client to connect to your instance. First, you must provide the correct access permissions to the .pem file. Usually, this means running chmod 400 /path/to/your/.pem. Once you do so, you can use the ssh command directly: . ssh -i /path/to/your/.pem ubuntu@&lt;your-EC2-hostname-here&gt; . (You must substitute in the path to your downloaded .pem file as well as the hostname of your EC2 instance, which takes the form of ec2-X-Y-Z.us.W.compute.amazonaws.com for some values of W, X, Y, and Z. Collect these values from the EC2 Console.) . If you receive an error that the path is “too long for Unix domain socket” or the like, open ~/.ssh/config in a text editor and modify the control path to match this (reference): . Host * ControlPath ~/.ssh/control/%C ControlMaster auto . At this point, you should be logged in to your EC2 Instance! See below for an example of connecting to such an instance from the WSL environment (though note that the machine in the screenshot uses an old version of Ubuntu. Your instance should be version 22.04 (codename: jammy) instead of version 16.04): . Once you’re all finished, you need one more step to install gcc (a compiler for C and C++ programs): . sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gcc . You can safely stop the VM instance when you aren’t using it (e.g., between homeworks) and restart it when you are. ",
