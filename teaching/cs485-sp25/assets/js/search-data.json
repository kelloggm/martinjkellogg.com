That is not correct: it will be on Monday and Wednesday mornings at 10am. Sorry for the confusion! . Welcome to CS 485: Compilers! This course teaches students how to build an optimizing compiler for a Java-like object-oriented programming language. Topics include program semantics, typechecking, intermediate representations like single static assignment (SSA) form, code generation, and classic compiler optimizations including register allocation via graph coloring, peephole optimizations, and dataflow analyses. Students will also be introduced to functional programming, and its advantages for transformation-based programs like compilers that have strict correctness requirements.

If this course were to be offered as a regular course, the prerequisite would be CS 280 with a grade of C or better, or the equivalent at another institution. Taking CS350 in the same semester as this course, or prior to it, is recommended but not required, provided students have some prior knowledge of assembly. Students will also benefit from taking CS 341 concurrently or before this course, because there are some relevant theory topics to optimization. Finally, this course includes a non-trivial programming project. Students who have taken a software engineering course (e.g., CS 490 with me) or otherwise have software engineering experience will probably have an easier time. The first homework assignment is due right at the drop date, and is intended to let you check that you have the basic skills that will be needed for this course. ",

    "title": "Participation &amp; Professionalism",
    "content": "Your participation &amp; professionalism grade is based on your interactions with the instructors and TAs: in-class, on the course discussion forum, in office hours, etc. Remote Participation . Generally this class does not support remote participation: teaching is much more effective, in my experience, when everyone is physically present. However, I understand that sometimes you are sick, traveling, or otherwise unable to come to class. I will arrange for remote participation in any particular lecture as long as you request it at least one hour in advance (if you’re sick or in some other emergency) or 24 hours in advance (if you’re traveling or otherwise planning to be unable to come to class). Notify the instructor via email if you need to participate in a particular class remotely. Asking Questions . There is a course Discord server which you can use to ask (and answer) questions about any of the course topics or for help with the homework. Participating on Discord is optional, but if you do participate in a productive manner (especially by answering other student’s questions!), it will have a positive impact on your participation score. Office Hours and Viewing Test Cases . In addition to offering you a chance to ask questions about the lecture material, the instructor’s office hours have a unique feature that can help you with the compiler’s programming assignments (i.e., PA2-4). During the instructor’s office hours (only—TA office hours do not count), once per assignment, each team (or student, if working individually) may ask to view the content of one test case from the grading server (you’ll need to ask by test case number). Note that “per assignment” means that you can use this power only three times per semester, by default: once each for PA2, PA3, and PA4. You can only use this power in-person, and you cannot record the result electronically (e.g., by taking a photo). The idea here is to allow you to get “unstuck” if there is a particularly tricky test case that you’re struggling with on the autograder. You can gain more uses of this power per assignment by choosing a language from a language bucket other than Bucket 1; see the languages page. ",

This assignment does not require any optimization, only correctness. | PA4: the COOL Optimizing Compiler: the optimizing compiler is a modified version of PA3 that also optimizes the x86-64 code that it produces. This project is judged on the speed of the generated assembly code (in addition to correctness). Students are required to 1) implement some specific optimizations, including dead code elimination, and 2) match the performance of the COOL reference compiler’s generated assembly.

You are permitted to copy small amounts of code from any source except someone else’s copy of an assignment, as long as you cite your source. “someone else’s copy of an assignment” also includes students not currently enrolled in the course - e.g., students who took this class in previous semesters or took classes that used similar projects at other institutions. To make this more clear, here are some examples of acceptable and unacceptable collaboration on a programming assignment in this course: . Acceptable collaborations: . | Discuss problems/solutions/anything with any number of other students (as long as you don’t look at each other’s code). | Copy a short (about 10 lines or fewer - use your judgment) snippet from stackoverflow.com or a similar source, as long as you include a comment with the source URL. | Copy code written by one of your teammates during a group project for another part of the group project. | Copy code from the output of a generative AI tool such as ChatGPT that you prompted yourself, if you include a link to a record of your interaction with the model (e.g., ChatGPT’s “share” feature) as a code comment. | . Unacceptable collaborations: . | Copy code directly from another student on an individual project. | Copy code from another group on a group project. | Copy a significant portion (more than about 10 lines of code or a single method - use your judgment) of your assignment from the internet, even if you cite your source. | Copy a short snippet from the internet without citing your source. | Copy code from the output of a generative AI tool (such as ChatGPT) without citing your source | Copy code from the output of a generative AI tool prompted by someone other than you (or your teammates, for a group project) | . These rules are intended to mimic what is acceptable in industry when working as a software engineer: using the resources available to you, such as your teammates and the wider internet, is always allowed. But, it would be illegal to copy code from a competing company working on a similar product. ",

    "title": "What is a research paper?",
    "content": "In computer science, original research is typically published at peer-reviewed conferences. Typically these papers have between two and ten authors, and the paper typically reports on about a person-year’s worth of work (though this can vary widely). The authors will be a mix of junior and senior researchers: anyone who contributed something “intellectually significant” to the paper is typically listed as an author. In most CS sub-disciplines (including software engineering, which is the source for most of the “Optional” readings), author order is indicative: the first author is usually the person who did most of the technical work (e.g., implementing the tool, running the experiments, etc.), and the last author is typically the project leader (often, but not always, the first author’s research advisor). Often, but not always, the first author is a PhD student. To be accepted at a peer-reviewed conference, a research paper must be novel: that is, it must contain some new knowledge or evidence that the research community wasn’t aware of before. This requirement impacts how they are written: a research paper must focus on the specific thing that is novel about it, rather than surveying the field as a whole (though you can find “survey” papers that give an overview of a research area, and if you need to know the current state of a sub-field, looking for a survey paper is the way to go).

Completing PA2-4 in a language from Bucket 1 has no penalties or benefits. Completing PA2-4 in a language from Bucket 2 entitles you to one extra test case view per assignment. Completing PA2-4 in a language from Bucket 3 entitles you to one extra test case view per assignment and one point of extra credit per assignment (only on the final submission, not on the checkpoints). You can switch languages between PA2 and PA3, but I don’t recommend doing so unless you really struggled with PA2. You should not switch between PA3 and PA4, because PA4 builds on PA3—I expect you to modify you PA3 implementation to complete PA4. See the assignment pages for more details. ",

    "title": "Specification",
    "content": "Your program must take in a list of dependent tasks and either output a valid order in which to perform them or the single word cycle. Your program will accept a number of lines of textual input (via standard input). There are no command-line arguments — you must always read from standard input. Do not open a named file. Instead, always read from standard input. That text input will contain a non-zero but even number of lines. Every two lines represent a pair of tasks. The first line gives the name of a task, the second line gives the name of a task that it depends on. This text input is also called the task list. The task list will contain only standard ASCII characters (no UTF/8 Unicode or special accents). The goal is to test programming and program language concepts, not your internationalization abilities. Each task name starts at the beginning of the line and extends all the way up to (but not including) the end of that line. So the newline or carriage return characters \\r or \\n are not part of the task name. Each task name is at most 60 characters long. (This limit is to make any C implementation easier. Most languages support longer strings natively, and can thus ignore this length limit.) . Example task list: . learn C read the C tutorial do PA1 learn C . The interpretation is that in order to learn C one must first read the C tutorial and that in order to do PA1 one must first learn C. Desired output for this example: . read the C tutorial learn C do PA1 . If the task list containts a cycle of any size, your program should output exactly and only the word cycle. Example cyclic input: . get a job have experience have experience work on a job work on a job get a job . Even if the task list contains a few non-cyclic parts, any single cycle forces you to output only the word cycle. Always output to standard output only. Do not write anything to stderr. There is no fixed limit on the number of lines in the task list (although it is not zero and it is even). Two tasks with the same name are really just the same task. Use standard string equality. Duplicated pairs of tasks are not allowed. For example: . learn C read the C tutorial do PA1 learn C learn C read the C tutorial . … that task list is not valid input because the pair learn C/read the C tutorial appears twice. Program behavior if the task list contains a duplicate pair is undefined. You will not be tested on it. Your program may not cause any other file I/O to be performed, such as creating a temporary file to keep track of some intermediate sorting results or writing to stderr (or even causing the interpreter to write a warning to stderr). You do not need any such temporary files or stderr-printing to solve this problem. Choosing Among Unconstrained Tasks . If there are multiple outstanding unconstrained tasks, your program should output them in ascending ASCII alphabetical order. That is, if you ever have two or more tasks, each of which has no remaining dependencies, output the one that comes first ASCII-alphabetically. (This constraint makes your program deterministic; for any given input there is only one correct output.) Example: . learn C understand C pointers learn C read the C tutorial do PA1 learn C . Because r comes before u, your output should be: . read the C tutorial understand C pointers learn C do PA1 . To put it another way, consider this task list: . B A C D C E . Which yields a dependency graph like this: . A D E | \\ / B C . The proper ordering for this set of tasks is A B D E C. Note that B comes before D and E, even though B depends on A. This is because, once A is finished, B is free to go and it comes first alphabetically. You may want to consider this requirement when you pick your sorting algorithm. Given this requirement the answer A D E B C is incorrect and will receive no credit. Resources . Some resources are available to help you: . | pa1-hint.zip provides concrete implementations of “task list reversal” (a similar, but simpler, problem) in a wide collection of languages, including many of those in our buckets. You might use this resource to compare how to accomplish various tasks in different languages. | pa1-testcases.zip includes a number of test inputs and expected outputs so that you can test your programs before submitting. | pa1-testcases-unix.zip as above, but with unix linefeed formatting in all text files for use in Mac OS X, Ubuntu, or another Linux. | . Commentary . This problem is just topological sort not-so-cleverly disguised. Feel free to look up how to do toposort on the internet (but remember that you must turn in your own work; you may not copy someone else’s code and claim it as your own). Take a look at the files in pa1-hint.zip. You could do worse than using them as starting points. If you’re having trouble writing anything reasonable in Cool, don’t forget to look at the other example Cool programs. Building and maintaining an explicit graph structure is probably overkill. Video Guides . This assignment is a mildly-modified version of Wes Weimer’s similar assignment (the only differences are in language choices). Wes has kindly prepared a number of video guides to help students get started in various languages: . | Python | OCaml | COOL (object-oriented style, long) | COOL (imperative style, short) | . Reminder: You can watch YouTube videos at 1.5x speed with full audio. Checkpoints . This assignment has two checkpoints before the final due date. At the first checkpoint, you must turn in your Bucket 1 implementation. At the second checkpoint, you must turn in any one implementation from a bucket other than Bucket 1. At the final due date, you need to turn in all four implementations. This structure is designed to encourage you to steadily work on the assignment, rather than trying to do all four implementations in a rush at the end. It also separates the task into three stages, each with a different challenge: (1) before the first checkpoint, the challenge is Can I write this program at all?, even in a familiar language; (2) between the first and second checkpoint, the challenge is Can I write this program in some other language?; (3) after the second checkpoint, the challenge is Can I write this program in multiple unfamiliar languages?. Note that although the checkpoints get progressively more difficult, the time alloted to them is about the same. That’s because I expect you to become very comfortable with this program by the time you’re working on your fourth implementation. The schedule for the checkpoints is: . | PA1c1: due Monday, January 27 AoE. Note that this is the the drop date. If you are struggling to finish PA1c1 in time, you should consider dropping the class: the workload is likely too high for you to handle this semester. | PA1c2: due Thursday, January 30 AoE. | full PA1: due Monday, February 3 AoE. | . Note the “AoE” timezone means “Anywhere on Earth”. This means that you can submit that part of the assignment as long as it is the given date somewhere on the planet. Currently, the last place where each day ends on Earth is the Howland and Baker Islands. This transition happens at about 7am eastern time the next day (but this can vary with daylight savings time!). I use AoE for due dates because I won’t actually start grading until the next day: if you want to stay up all night doing the assignment, that’s your business. It also means that when I say that an assignment is due on a particular date (e.g., “PA1 is due on February 3rd”), you unambiguously know what I mean. What To Turn In For PA1c1 . For PA1c1, turn in any one of the following files: . | rosetta.py (Python) | rosetta.c (C) | rosetta.cpp (C++) | Rosetta.java (Java) | . We will use the file extension to determine which language you are using. See the languages page for information about the versions of each language that the grading server supports. What To Turn In For PA1c2 . Submit any one of the following files: . | rosetta.kt (Kotlin) | rosetta.rs (Rust) | Rosetta.scala (Scala) | rosetta.hs (Haskell) | rosetta.ml (OCaml) | rosetta.cl (COOL) | . What To Turn In For PA1 . Turn in six files: . | any one of rosetta.py, rosetta.c, rosetta.cpp, or Rosetta.java | any one of rosetta.kt, rosetta.rs, or Rosetta.scala | either rosetta.hs or rosetta.ml | rosetta.cl | testcase.list, which should contain a valid novel task list (it may or may not contain a cycle — your choice). Novel in this context means “different from the test cases distributed with the assignment in some meaningful way that you will identify in your README.txt. | README.txt, a plain ASCII text file (not a Word file, not an RTF file, not an HTML file) describing your design decisions. Which language did you start with? How did you store the (implicit) graph? Which language was the hardest? Why is your test case novel? One or two English paragraphs should suffice. Spelling, grammar, capitalization and punctuation all count. | . Grading Rubric . PA1 Grading (out of 25 points): . | 20 points — autograding . | 5 points — autograder tests for PA1c1 | 5 points - autograder tests for PA1c2 | 10 points — autograder tests for PA1 | The scoring is proportional: if there are 8 tests for PA1c1 and your best submission passes 4 of them (50%), you will receive 2.5/5 points for PA1c1 (50%). | . | 4 points — for a clear description in your README.txt . | 4 — thorough discussion of design decisions (including language comparisons) and choice of test cases; a few paragraphs of coherent English sentences should be fine | 2 — vague or hard to understand; omits important details | 0 — little to no effort, or submitted an RTF/DOC/PDF file instead of plain TXT | . | 1 point — for a valid testcase.list file | .

    "content": "The Rosetta Stone aided linguistic understanding by providing the same text in three different languages. In this project you will implement the same simple program in four separate languages. Each of your implementations will have exactly the same interface, will otherwise adhere to the same specification, and should behave exactly the same way. You must choose one language from each of the following buckets for your four implementations: . | Bucket 1: Languages You Already Know: Java, C, C++, or Python3 | Bucket 2: Languages With An Unusual Type System: Kotlin, Rust, or Scala | Bucket 3: Functional Languages: OCaml or Haskell | Bucket 4: Project Language: Classroom Object-Oriented Language (COOL) | . Each bucket is intended to challenge you in a different way. Bucket 1 gives you a chance to implement the solution in a language you’re already comfortable in, so that you can focus on the problem. Bucket 2 challenges you to redo that implementation in a language that shares some similarities with languages that you’ve seen before, but which also includes some features you might be unfamiliar with. In particular, all Bucket 2 languages support programming in a structured imperative style, even if they permit functional programming. Bucket 3 challenges you to redo the implementation in a true functional programming language. Finally, Bucket 4 will familiarize you with the course project language COOL (“Classroom Object-Oriented Language”). All subsequent assignments in this course (PA2-PA4) involve implementing parts of a COOL compiler, so you’ll have an easier time with them if you’ve used the language a bit. COOL itself is also a bit tricky to program in: it intentionally omits many convenience features of higher-level languages to simplify the compiler implementation process, but that can make it unwieldy for writing “real” programs. For this assignment, you must work alone. Subsequent assignments will allow you (optionally) to work in pairs. ",

    "content": "There are two options that this tutorial covers: . | Option 1: Local: Set up a local Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual machine on your computer. This is the most popular option for individual assignments, but the individual assignments typically work in most environments (so you probably don’t need to do this unless you run into a problem). It has a nice UI that makes it easy to navigate. | Some students may have WSL Ubuntu set up. It is a different version of Ubuntu and may or may not work for this class: we recomend that you follow the instructions below if you run into trouble. However, your experience setting it up will help you here! | Some student reports that VirtualBox is not compatible with the new Macbooks (e.g., with M1 and M2 chipsets). If you are using such a Macbook, you may have to select the Option 2 below and use the Cloud instead of your local machine. | Some students have experience with docker. Unfortunately, docker will not suffice here (but experience with it will help you): follow the instructions below. | Some students already have other versions of Ubuntu installed. Covey.town will probably work fine on these other versions, but again if you run into trouble you should follow these instructions. | . | Option 2: Cloud: Set up an Amazon EC2 cloud instance with Ubuntu 22.04 running on it. This option will work if you have a slower or older computer. Start early; Amazon takes up to 24 hours to verify cloud computing accounts. This option involves more of a command-line interface but typically runs some course tools a bit faster than local machine. This option also has the advantage that you can easily run a webserver (or other publicly-accessible webservice, such as covey.town!) from an EC2 instance. | . Both options should work with all assignments in this course. Option 1 (local VM) will have you install VirtualBox on your computer, download an Ubuntu 22.04 installation image, and install x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 in your virtual machine. A reasonably modern computer (e.g., at most 5 years old) should be able to run a VM guest without issue. However, some students report that the VM executes too slowly (e.g., the mouse is laggy, keystrokes are missed, programs take too long, etc.). If your VM guest is too slow, you can consider using Option 2 instead (see below). First, you may want to read the summary of virtual machines and cloud computing below. Even if you are familiar with the concepts from previous experiences, this course may use slightly different terminology, and I recommend that you skim the material (click on the box below to see the background material). Background: Virtual Machines and Cloud Computing A Virtual Machine is an emulation of a computer system. Loosely, you can think of a VM as a program that can run an entire virtual computer system. Virtual machines are powerful software systems that enable running software designed for one operating system inside another operating system. For example, you can use your Windows host computer to run a Virtual Machine that contains a Linux operating system. Consider the image below: . This is a Windows 10 host_computer running three different Virtual Machine _guests. The guest instances are complete (virtual) environments that are isolated from the host. All of the guests share the host’s hardware as they execute — each window in the screenshot above lets you interact with a separate emulated guest. Thus, even though the host is a Windows computer, you can use one of the guests to execute Linux software inside the guest. Virtual Machines can be used in many combinations. You can have a Windows, Linux, or Mac host computer, and run arbitary numbers and combinations of Linux and Windows guests. Finally, guests are stored as files in the host computer — this means you can move your VM guest from one host to another by transferring that file around. Option 1 (“Local”): You can choose to set up and run your own Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine locally. This will allow you complete all of the assignments in this course within that virtual machine. However, some students report that the VM guest runs too slowly (especially if you do not have enough RAM in your computer). If you find that a local VM is too slow, you can use Option 2 instead. Virtual machines are a critical part of Cloud computing. You can “rent out” computing resources from a provider like Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure to do whatever computation you might need. Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure both offer you virtual machine guests that run on their hardware. Thus, you can get access to a virtual machine running whatever operating system you like to run a variety of software. Option 2 (“Cloud”): If you find that a local VM is too slow, you can instead get a free Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine from Amazon EC2 (or any other cloud computing provider, but this specification walks you through how to do it on EC2). Amazon EC2 (“Elastic Cloud Compute”) is a service that lets you buy and configure virtual machines. Option 2 has you setup and launch an Ubuntu 22.04 cloud instance (this is free if you are a student). Many of the assignments are easier to complete on Linux or similar command-line systems. If you’re not comfortable with such systems, the background tab below on Linux Fundamentals might be useful: . Background: Linux Fundamentals Vanderbilt professor Kevin Leach has prepared a (long) video that provides a gentle introduction to a number of Linux concepts that are relevant to this course. This video is optional, but you may find it useful if you are less familiar with the Linux environment. There are timestamps in a comment below the video that contain points of interest, such as: . | terminals | environment variables | scripts in the shell | compiling programs from source | using ssh | . The first half is more about terminals and shells (why do we have to type ./a.out? why can’t we just say a.out?), and the second half is more about compiling programs from source. The video also covers elinks in particular, which is a terminal-based browser program (using elinks is not required for this course, but it might be helpful if you choose to use a cloud computer and need to access the web to e.g., submit an assignment).

If your CPU does not support virtualization extensions, then your VM may run slowly. If that’s the case, consider Option 2 for this assignment instead. You will need: . | A copy of VirtualBox for your operating system. General download link (look under “Platform Package” or similar). | A copy of 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 (Download — 64-bit is required here: don’t use 32-bit). This is a large .iso file that might take a long time to download. You don’t need it until part way through the installation process, but you should start the download now. | When something goes wrong during this installation, we recommend that you search this webpage and also look for previous posts on the forum. Some solutions may be listed a little lower on the webpage than when you encounter them. Macs typically give students many more issues than Windows machines, so if you are a student using a Mac, looking to see if the issue is already addressed can be a big time saver. | . VirtualBox . VirtualBox is a Virtual Machine Manager. You install VirtualBox on your host computer (i.e., as a regular program or app). Then, you use VirtualBox to create a virtual machine guest. Once you have created a guest, you install Ubuntu 22.04 inside of the guest. Then, you can start the guest and have a complete Ubuntu 22.04 environment within that guest. Isolation in Virtual Machine Guests Note well: Implicit here is that the guest is, to some extent, isolated from the host. This is very important and entails a number of conceptual hurdles if you are not used to virtualization: . | The clipboard is isolated. That is, if you copy something from your host environment, you cannot paste it inside the guest environment. This is because the VM guest is a completely independent operating system environment from your host. | Typing and mouse movements have to be captured by the guest. | If you want to download a file to use in the guest, you must do so from the guest environment. Unless you set up a shared drive (which is not required), you have to download or create files within the guest environment rather than the host environment. | . Installing VirtualBox . You can install VirtualBox with the default settings. For your reference, screenshots of the course staff completing the installation are shown below: .

Next, it will ask you to create an account for logging in. You can put whatever credentials you like here — it will not have any bearing on your host computer. This is merely for an account on the guest VM. Just make sure you don’t forget whatever password you choose! . Next, you just wait a bit for the OS to install inside the guest. It might take a few minutes to complete. Eventually, you’ll see a screen asking you to remove installaton media and restart. You can just click restart (on the guest) and you’ll be all set! . Virtual Machines and Mice While you’re running the VM, you may find that it “takes control” of your mouse and keyboard, and you aren’t able to leave the window. If this happens, press CTRL+ALT to release control from the VM window. (The keystrokes may be different on Mac OS). ",

In our opinion, one thing that makes the experience way better is the VirtualBox Additions package. It provides a number of “Quality of Life” features when using VMs. It’s essentially a helper program you install inside the VM guest that makes it “aware” that it’s running inside of a VM. To install, click “Devices”, then “Insert Guest Additions CD Image…” . Eventually, a window pops up asking if you want to run the media. Just click Run. After installing, you can reboot the VM image. One more step to make sure gcc (a compiler for C and C++ programs) is installed in your guest. In a terminal, use: . sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gcc . You’re all set! . ",

    "content": "Note well: This option will take longer than Option 1. Amazon AWS accounts can take up to 24 hours to verify, which means you may have to wait before you can use it for an assignment or demo. Start early! . You will need a Secure Shell (SSH) client. SSH allows you to remotely interact with a server. (If you’ve never used SSH before, scrolling back up the page and watching the appropriate section of the “Linux Fundamentals” video might help.) When you SSH to a remote computer, you have access to a command prompt that runs software on that computer. We will be using SSH to interact with a virtual machine we create in the cloud with Amazon EC2. On Windows, I recommend using WSL to run SSH. You can also use PuTTY. On Mac, you should already have ssh installed. Open a terminal and you can run ssh. On Linux, you can use ssh, but you may need to install it first (e.g., sudo apt-get install openssh or similar, depending on your platform). It is your responsibility to understand how to use SSH, though we give some pointers below. Amazon EC2 is a cloud computing service that allows you to rent virtual machines that you can ssh to and run programs like any other computer. Amazon offers a large number of cloud-based services all under the umbrella of AWS (Amazon Web Services). EC2 is a subset of AWS. In this section, you will create an AWS account to manage EC2 virtual machines. You can sign up for a new account on Amazon EC2, and in doing so, you get 12 months of free access to a virtual machine that is enough to complete the assignments in this course. If you do not already have an Amazon EC2 account, navigate to https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ and click “Create new account” in the upper right. Complete the sign up process. You may be prompted for credit card information, however you should not be charged as long as you create only one virtual machine on the free tier. You then will have access to the Amazon AWS Console. If you are prompted, you want to sign in as a “Root” user for the AWS console. AWS Account Creation Note that it can take 24 hours for Amazon to verify your account. We believe this is because they manually review account creation — after all, they are giving you access to computing resources. Since cloud services are easily abused (e.g., for spam emails, command and control virus management, and distributed denial of service attacks), Amazon applies a bit of scrutiny to AWS users. Start early! . Notice: AWS Web GUI Changes Some of the screenshots in this guide are from older versions of the AWS Web Interface. The GUI changes fairly frequently and so your view may look a little different from the screenshots. Everything is fine and it’s good practice to follow along with documentation that is not an exact match. The course staff verified that the instructions work and pass the HW0 autograder most recently on 8/27/2022. If you believe you’ve discovered a problematic difference between this guide and the current version of the AWS GUI, contact your TA. Creating a New VM . Now that you have created an account, you can use the AWS Console to help manage and launch virtual machine instances. We will walk you through the steps to create an Ubuntu 22.04 VM below. (1) Open the AWS Console . After you create an AWS account, you can visit the AWS Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com. At the console, you should be greeted with a large screen full of many services. See highlight on left: . Click here to see AWS Console screenshot . (2) Open the EC2 Manager . From the AWS Console, click the “EC2” link to open the Elastic Cloud Compute manager. The EC2 Manager lets you manage and launch Instances, which are virtual machines that you configure. The first thing we need to do is configure and launch a new instance. Click the Launch Instance button. Click here to see EC2 Manager screenshot . (3) Choose an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Instance . This is the most important step. You must select an Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type instance. This is a free tier eligible instance that contains an environment suitable for completing the rest of the assignments. Don’t pick other versions of Ubuntu (NOT 18.04 or 20.04, etc.). The autograder uses Ubuntu 22.04 (in an AWS VM!), so if you want the smoothest experience, use that version. As of 1/12/2023, the correct image is the default for Ubuntu: . Click here to see screenshot of the instructor selecting the correct VM image . After that you can fill out the rest of the selection (e.g., making certain to select your key pair for that instance) and then verify that it is in the Free Tier. Click here for \"free tier\" screenshot . (4) Configure Your Instance . After you select the image to launch, it may ask you a few questions about storage (pick the default if so). Usually, it will skip ahead and ask you about instance details. You want to pick the free version, called a t2.micro instance. If you were using cloud computing for a business or another project, you could configure resources like (a) how many CPUs, (b) how much RAM, and (c) what type of storage you get on the VM. For this course, just pick “t2.micro” to get the free level. Click here for instance type selection screenshot . (5) Configure Authentication . After you set up your instance, you need to create a way to login. This is a tricky security problem because Amazon wants to give you root (Administrator) access to your new instance. The way they do this is by using asymmetric key encryption. Basically, Amazon will let you download a file that serves as your credentials. Rather than entering a password, you will provide this special file to let you login. If you’d like to learn more about asymmetric key encryption, take a security course. Now, you will be prompted to set up credentials for logging in. Select Create a new key pair and type in any name (the examples use “eecs481” in the screenshots below). (If you are given a key type option, like “RSA” vs. “ED22519”, pick “RSA”.) Then, click Download Key Pair. It is imperative that you keep this file in a secure location. Do not upload it to GitHub, do not move it around. This is basically like a password for accessing your instance — you wouldn’t want someone malicious to access your instance and do something bad with it (you would be legally responsible for whatever they did!). Click here for keypair creation screenshot . Once you had downloaded your Key Pair, you should be able to Launch your instance. Do so and continue. There is a screenshot below showing what you should see after launching your instance. Click here for launch confirmation screenshot . (6) Connect to Your Instance . At this point, you have set up an Ubuntu 22.04 instance on EC2 and created associated credentials. You now have a virtual machine running in the cloud that you can connect to. You will use ssh to connect to your instance. This is the recommended way — you could technically install a front-end and use remote desktop software, however we strongly recommend using the command line, since you will be using the CLI in many of the course assignments. From the EC2 Management Dashboard, right-click your running instance. You should see a menu pop up like below: . Click “Connect”. It will pop up a window giving you a number of options. Pick the “SSH Client” tab to see how to connect via ssh: . On this window, you will see the hostname of your EC2 instance to which you can ssh, as well as a number of instructions for connecting. Mac permissions errors Some students, especially those using Mac computers, report receiving permission errors when they try to SSH into their EC2 instances: . In this case, a command like . chmod go-rwx /path/to/eecs481.pem . usually resolves the issue. More information is available online about this SSH issue. Using Windows WSL to SSH to EC2 If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to connect to your Amazon EC2 instance, you must prepare your key file before connecting. Our recommendation is to run the following (but use your path): . mkdir -p ~/.ssh/ cp /path/to/your/downloaded/eecs481.pem ~/.ssh chmod 400 ~/.ssh/eecs481.pem . Windows WSL does not apply Linux file permissions correctly unless you are dealing with files contained within the Linux FS. Moving your key to ~/.ssh/ will allow you to chmod 400 appropriately. The SSH client will not allow you to connect to any server using that key if it does not have the correct permissions. Recall you downloaded a .pem file when you set up authentication for your instance (see part 5 above). You must specify this file on your SSH client to connect to your instance. First, you must provide the correct access permissions to the .pem file. Usually, this means running chmod 400 /path/to/your/.pem. Once you do so, you can use the ssh command directly: . ssh -i /path/to/your/.pem ubuntu@&lt;your-EC2-hostname-here&gt; . (You must substitute in the path to your downloaded .pem file as well as the hostname of your EC2 instance, which takes the form of ec2-X-Y-Z.us.W.compute.amazonaws.com for some values of W, X, Y, and Z. Collect these values from the EC2 Console.) . If you receive an error that the path is “too long for Unix domain socket” or the like, open ~/.ssh/config in a text editor and modify the control path to match this (reference): . Host * ControlPath ~/.ssh/control/%C ControlMaster auto . At this point, you should be logged in to your EC2 Instance! See below for an example of connecting to such an instance from the WSL environment (though note that the machine in the screenshot uses an old version of Ubuntu. Your instance should be version 22.04 (codename: jammy) instead of version 16.04): . Once you’re all finished, you need one more step to install gcc (a compiler for C and C++ programs): . sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gcc . You can safely stop the VM instance when you aren’t using it (e.g., between homeworks) and restart it when you are. ",
