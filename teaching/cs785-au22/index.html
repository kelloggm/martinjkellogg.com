<b>Course Overview:</b> 

Introduces and contrasts common static program analysis techniques
(including abstract interpretation, type systems, heuristic
bug-finding, incorrectness logic, verification by reduction to SMT,
and more). Students will have the opportunity to gain experience with
several program analysis techniques and to gain an intuition for the
practical problems that come up when building program analysis tools.

<b>Project Information:</b> 

This course includes a semester-long research project, which
is cumulatively worth 50% of each students grade in the class.
Students are permitted to work alone or in teams of up to 3 (I
recommend working in a team, because although I will have higher
expectations for team projects, students usually report that working
together is easier). The main goal of the course project should be
to do a (small) research project that is related to one of the themes or
topics of the class. I recommend strongly that students draw on their
own research interests when choosing a project: I do not mind if you
"double-count" the research you were going to do anyway as (part of) your
course project, too, as long as it is related to program analysis.
While I do expect some novelty in your course projects, the standard is
much lower than it would be for e.g., a conference paper.

The project itself is structured iteratively: throughout the semester you
will submit several versions of a document that will eventually become
your final project report. Each project team will also present their project
to the class several times during the semester. The most effective way
to lower your grade in this course is to ignore the feedback that I give
you on these reports and presentations. Even if you disagree with it, please
either address it or communicate with me (via email, in-person, etc.)
why you disagree.
