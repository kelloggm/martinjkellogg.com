Skim "Precise Interprocedural Dataflow Analysis via Graph Reachability,
focusing on understanding the idea of the core algorithm rather than the
specific details provided in the paper.
Then, read "Inter-procedural data-flow analysis with IFDS/IDE and Soot;
you should understand IFDS well-enough to make sense of section 2.
Then, answer the following questions:

1. The "D" in IFDS stands for "distributive". What does it mean for flow functions to
be distributive?

2. What does the "0" node mean in an exploded super-graph?

3. What is the difference between IFDS and IDE?

4. What was the most confusing part of the reading? Is there anything you still don't understand?

5. How much time did you spend on this assignment (both the reading and answering the questions, combined)?
