Read "FlowDroid: Precise Context, Flow, Object-sensitive and Lifecylce-aware Taint
Analysis for Android Apps", and then answer the following questions:

1. The FlowDroid paper refers to a "dummy" main() method. Why is the main() method
a "dummy", and why is it necessary? (There are two answers to the second part of
this question: one related to Android and one related to IFDS. You should give both.)

2. What is interesting about FlowDroid's handling of possible aliasing?

3. What is the scientific purpose of the proposed DroidBench? (Hint: the authors specifically
complain about a deficiency of the scientific literature in the paper that DroidBench
might help solve.)

4. What was the most confusing part of the reading? Is there anything you still don't understand?

5. How much time did you spend on this assignment (both the reading and answering the questions, combined)?
