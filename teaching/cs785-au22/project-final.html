<h1>CS 785: Course Project: Final Report</h1>

<p>
  Complete the project report document you have been working on this semester. Be sure to address all feedback you've received up
  to this point. There are two submission deadlines for the final report: a draft deadline and a resubmission deadline.
  The draft deadline is required, but the resubmission deadline is optional: if you are happy with your draft report,
  you are not required to submit to the resubmission deadline. Your grade on the final report and final proposals will constitute
  half of your project grade for the semester, so you should take advantage of the resubmission deadline if you're at all
  worried about your course grade. A good resubmission must address all comments on the draft report and on the final presentation.
  Resubmissions are also permitted (but not required to) include any data gathered after the draft deadline but before
  the resubmission deadline.
