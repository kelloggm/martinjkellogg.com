Read "Extended Static Checking for Java" and then answer the following questions
on Canvas:

1. Complete the DPLL(T) example we began in class on Thursday. If it is satisfiable,
provide a satisfying assignment. If it is unsatisfiable, provide an unsatisfiable core.

Recall that the initial formula was the following (&& is "and"/wedge, || is "or"/vee):

(f(a)!=f(b) || d!=e) &&
(a=b || a!=c) &&
(a=b || c=b) &&
(a=c || P) &&
(c!=b || !P)

We'd chosen the following theory variables:
T1 = f(a)=f(b)
T2 = d=e
T3 = a=b
T4 = a=c
T5 = c=b

2. ESC/Java is unsound, despite being built on a sound theoretical foundataion (i.e., Hoare
Logic and VC generation, as we discussed in class).
Give one example of a way it is unsound, and briefly state
why the authors chose to make the tool unsound in that way.

3. A ghost field is no longer necessary for specifying the type contained in a Vector
in Java (because of generics, which were introduced after this paper was published).
Give a example of a situation where a ghost field might be useful that is applicable
to modern Java.

4. What was the most confusing part of the reading? Is there anything you still don't understand?

5. How much time did you spend on this assignment (both the reading and answering the questions, combined)?
