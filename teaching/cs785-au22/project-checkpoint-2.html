<h1>CS 785: Course Project: Checkpoint 2</h1>

<p>
  For this checkpoint, you should submit an updated version of your <a href="project-checkpoint-1.html">checkpoint 1</a>
  document that details your work so far. Your goal at this stage is to have mostly completed the structure
  of your project report, so that you can focus the last few weeks on getting final results.
</p>

<p>
  In this checkpoint, you should be sure to address the following things:
  <ul>
    <li>Address any feedback you have received from the instructor on your last project checkpoint report and on your most recent presentation.</li>
    <li>Have a complete related work section. After this checkpoint, neither you nor the instructor should discovered relevant related work that you do not cite in this checkpoint.</li>
    <li>Have a complete technical design section. All major design decisions should be made; after this checkpoint, you should not need to make significant changes to your technical approach.</li>
    <li>Have a complete experimental methodology. You should not need to make changes to the experimental methodology after this checkpoint.</li>
    <li>Include a link to a GitHub repository containing your current implementation. Your implementation should work on simple examples (that is, it should be at least at an "alpha" stage).</li>
    <li>At least one line in each table should be filled in: that is, for each experiment you plan to perform, you should have already performed the simplest case of that experiment. So, for example, if you are doing case studies of a tool, you should have completed at least one case study. If you are building a tool and evaluating it on several projects, you should have a working tool that runs on at least one project (probably the smallest, simplest one). If you are doing a user study, you should have finished with one participant. If you're not sure what this requirement means in the context of the project you're doing, reach out to the instructor.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  When a project is going well, what is submitted for this checkpoint usually is very similar to the final report: the final report includes
  more data, but otherwise is structured identically. So, if you do a good job on this checkpoint, you're saving yourself work later:
  your final report will be easy to write!
