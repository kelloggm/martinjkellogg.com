Read "Accumulation Analysis" and then skim "Verifying Object Construction" to see how an
accumulation analysis is useful in practice. Then, answer these reading questions:

1. Consider Table III of the paper "Effective typestate verification in the
presence of aliasing", which we read for last class. Name one example
from the table of a typestate property that is an accumulation typestate
property, and one example of a typestate property that is not.

2. What is the purpose of the TS-LOAD-FIX rule? If the language of the
proof had no fields (i.e., no loads or stores), would the problem solved
by this rule come up?

3. Give an example of alias reasoning that is done by the practical
accumulation analysis discussed in "Verifying Object Construction". How is this alias
reasoning different than running a whole-program alias analysis?

4. What was the most confusing part of the reading? Is there anything you still don't understand?

5. How much time did you spend on this assignment (both the reading and answering the questions, combined)?
