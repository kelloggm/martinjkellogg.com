Skim Chapter 1 of "Calculus of Computation", sections 1 to 1.6 (pages
14-33 in the PDF) to make sure you understand the basics of
propositional logic. Then read the remainder of chapter 1 (section
1.7, pages 33-43) in detail. Then, answer these questions:

1. Do exercise 1.8, part a.

2. Do exercise 1.8, part b.

3. What was the most confusing part of the reading? Is there anything you still don't understand?

4. How much time did you spend on this assignment (both the reading and answering the questions, combined)?
