Read Programming Z3 and then answer the following questions:

1. What is the motivation for including different theories in Z3? Why isn't just SAT enough?

2. Max discussed his egg tool in his guest lecture on Tuesday. Which theories (if any) described
in section 3 of "Programming Z3" might be solvable by reducing them to e-graphs and using
egg to solve them? In a sentence for each theory in section 3, why or why not?

3. In at most two sentences, why is it sound for Z3 to combine multiple theories? (Hint:
your answer might involve the phrase "Nelson-Oppen".)

4. What was the most confusing part of the reading? Is there anything you still don't understand?

5. How much time did you spend on this assignment (both the reading and answering the questions, combined)?
