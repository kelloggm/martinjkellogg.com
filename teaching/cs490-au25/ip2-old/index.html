id="main-content" class="main-content" role="main"><p>The objective for this semester’s individual project is to implement this new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GameArea</code> abstraction, with one concrete implementation: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeArea</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeArea</code> will implement the gameplay for the classic game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic-Tac-Toe</a>. This implementation effort will be split across two deliverables. In this second deliverable, you will implement and (partially) test the core frontend components.</p><h2 id="objectives-of-this-assignment"> <a href="#objectives-of-this-assignment" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="objectives-of-this-assignment"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Objectives of this assignment</h2><p>The objectives of this assignment are to:</p><ul><li>Investigate and understand a large, existing codebase<li>Write new TypeScript code that uses asynchronous operations<li>Write test cases that utilize mocks and spies<li>Write React components and hooks that make use of state</ul><h2 id="getting-started-with-this-assignment"> <a href="#getting-started-with-this-assignment" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="getting-started-with-this-assignment"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Getting started with this assignment</h2><p>Start by <a href="../assets/ip2-handout.zip">downloading the starter code</a>. Extract the archive and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> to fetch the dependencies.</p><p><strong>Configuring Jest and VSCode</strong>: If you would like to use the built-in Jest test runner for VSCode (where it shows the tests and their status in the sidebar), the easiest way to accomplish this for this project is to open <em>just</em> the “frontend” directory or just the “townService” directory in VSCode - not the top-level “ip2-handout” directory. If you have a quick-fix to make it work with the whole project at once, please feel free to share on Discord and we will incorportate that here.</p><p><strong>NPM install failures</strong>: The libraries used for React require some native binaries to be installed – code written and compiled for your computer (not JavaScript). If you run into issues with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> not succeeding, please try installing the following libraries using either <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew (if on Mac)</a>, apt-get, or your favorite other package manager: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pixman</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cairo</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pkgconfig</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pango</code>. For example, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install pixman cairo pkgconfig pango</code>. If you are on a newer Mac with an M1 or M2 chip, you may need to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arch -arm64 brew install pixman cairo pango</code>. On Windows: Students have reported seeing the failure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error /bin/bash: node: command not found</code> upon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend</code> directory. If you encounter this error, please try to delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node_modules</code> directory and re-run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend</code> directory from a bash shell instead of a windows command prompt.</p><p><strong>Running the app</strong>: We strongly encourage you to interactively experiment as you develop by running the entire application in your development environment. See the instructions in README.md for how to run the app.</p><h2 id="grading"> <a href="#grading" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="grading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Grading</h2><p>This submission will be scored out of 200 points, 180 of which will be automatically awarded by the grading script, with the remaining 20 manually awarded by the course staff.</p><p>Your code will automatically be evaluated for linter errors and warnings. Submissions that have <em>any</em> linter errors will automatically receive a grade of 0. <strong>Do not wait to run the linter until the last minute</strong>. To check for linter errors, run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run lint</code> from the terminal. The handout contains the same eslint configuration that is used by our grading script.</p><p>Your code will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a test suite that expands on the core tests that are distributed in the handout. Your tests will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a process that will inject bugs into our reference solution: to receive full marks your tests must detect a minimum number of injected bugs. Each submission will be graded against the same set of injected bugs (repeated submissions will not receive new/different injected bugs). You will <strong>not</strong> receive detailed feedback on which injected bugs you do or do not find.</p><p>The autograding script will impose a strict rate limit of 5 submissions per 24 hours. Submissions that fail to grade will not count against the quota. This limit exists to encourage you to start early on this assignment: students generally report that assignments like this take between 3-20 hours. If you start early, you will be able to take full advantage of the resources that we provide to help you succeed: office hours, discussion on Discord — and the ability to have a greater total number of submission attempts.</p><p>Your code will be manually evaluated for conformance to our course <a href="/martinjkellogg.com/teaching/cs490-au25//policies/style/">style guide</a>. This manual evaluation will account for 10% of your total grade on this assignment. We will manually evaluate your code for style on the following rubric:</p><p>To receive all 20 points:</p><ul><li>All new names (e.g. for local variables, methods, and properties) follow the naming conventions defined in our style guide<li>There are no unused local variables<li>All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) are documented with JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does, as defined in our style guide<li>The code and tests that you write generally follows the design principles discussed in week one. In particular, your design does not have duplicated code that could have been refactored into a shared method.</ul><p>We will review your code and note each violation of this rubric. We will deduct four points for each violation, up to a maximum of deducting all 20 style points.</p><h2 id="implementation-tasks"> <a href="#implementation-tasks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="implementation-tasks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Implementation Tasks</h2><p>This deliverable has four parts; each part will be graded on its own rubric. You should complete the assignment one part at a time, in the order presented here.</p><p><strong>General Requirements</strong>: Implement your code <em>only</em> in the files specified:</p><ul><li>Task 1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend/src/classes/interactable/TicTacToeAreaController.ts</code><li>Task 1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend/src/classes/interactable/TicTacToeAreaController.test.ts</code><li>Task 2: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend/src/components/Town/interactables/TicTacToe/TicTacToeArea.tsx</code><li>Task 3: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend/src/components/Town/interactables/TicTacToe/TicTacToeBoard.tsx</code><li>Task 4: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend/src/components/Town/interactables/Leaderboard.tsx</code></ul><p>You should not install any additional dependencies. The autograder will ignore any other files that you modify, and will not install any dependencies that you add to the project.</p><h3 id="task-1-the-tictactoeareacontroller-30-points"> <a href="#task-1-the-tictactoeareacontroller-30-points" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="task-1-the-tictactoeareacontroller-30-points"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Task 1: The TicTacToeAreaController (30 points)</h3><p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeAreaController</code> is a class that is responsible for managing the state of a single TicTacToe game. It is responsible for communicating with the TownService backend. Frontend components will interact with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeAreaController</code> to get the current state of the game, and to send commands to the backend to update the game state. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeAreaController</code> also will emit events when the state of the game changes, so that frontend components can update their state accordingly.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeAreaController</code> extends the base <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GameAreaController</code> class. The base class tracks the game model (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this._model</code>), the set of players in the game (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this.players</code>), and the set of observers in the game (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this.observers</code>). It also provides methods for joining and leaving the game, as well as a base implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_updateFrom</code>, which is responsible for updating the game state when the backend notifies the frontend of a change.</p><p>Your first task is to implement each of the properties and methods of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeAreaController</code> class (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend/src/classes/interactable/TicTacToeAreaController.ts</code>). The specification for these properties and methods appears below:</p><details> <summary>View the specification for these methods</summary><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-typescript" data-lang="typescript">  <span class="p">{</span>

 * The TicTacToeArea component renders the TicTacToe game area.
 * It renders the current state of the area, optionally allowing the player to join the game.
 *
 * It uses Chakra-UI components (does not use other GUI widgets)
 *
 * It uses the TicTacToeAreaController to get the current state of the game.
 * It listens for the 'gameUpdated' and 'gameEnd' events on the controller, and re-renders accordingly.
 * It subscribes to these events when the component mounts, and unsubscribes when the component unmounts. It also unsubscribes when the gameAreaController changes.
 *
 * It renders the following:
 * - A leaderboard (@see Leaderboard.tsx), which is passed the game history as a prop
 * - A list of observers' usernames (in a list with the aria-label 'list of observers in the game', one username per-listitem)
 * - A list of players' usernames (in a list with the aria-label 'list of players in the game', one item for X and one for O)
 *    - If there is no player in the game, the username is '(No player yet!)'
 *    - List the players as (exactly) `X: ${username}` and `O: ${username}`
 * - A message indicating the current game status:
 *    - If the game is in progress, the message is 'Game in progress, {moveCount} moves in, currently {whoseTurn}'s turn'. If it is currently our player's turn, the message is 'Game in progress, {moveCount} moves in, currently your turn'
 *    - Otherwise the message is 'Game {not yet started | over}.'
 * - If the game is in status WAITING_TO_START or OVER, a button to join the game is displayed, with the text 'Join New Game'
 *    - Clicking the button calls the joinGame method on the gameAreaController
 *    - Before calling joinGame method, the button is disabled and has the property isLoading set to true, and is re-enabled when the method call completes
 *    - If the method call fails, a toast is displayed with the error message as the description of the toast (and status 'error')
 *    - Once the player joins the game, the button dissapears
 * - The TicTacToeBoard component, which is passed the current gameAreaController as a prop (@see TicTacToeBoard.tsx)
 *
 * - When the game ends, a toast is displayed with the result of the game:
 *    - Tie: description 'Game ended in a tie'
 *    - Our player won: description 'You won!'
 *    - Our player lost: description 'You lost :('

Please contact the instructors immediately if you have difficulty accessing the course on Gradescope. If you were not on the course roster at the beginning of the semester, check Discord for the Gradescope entry code.</p><p>To submit your assignment: run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run zip</code> in the top-level directory of the handout. This will produce a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">covey-town.zip</code>. Submit that zip file on Gradescope.</p><p>Gradescope will provide you with feedback on your submission, but note that it will <em>not</em> include any marks that will be assigned after we manually grade your submission for code style (these marks will remain hidden until it is graded). It may take up to 40 minutes for the grading script to complete.</p><p>Gradescope is configured to only provide feedback on at most 5 submissions per-24-hours per-student (submissions that fail to run or receive a grade of 0 are not counted in that limit). We strongly encourage you to lint and test your submission on your local development machine, and <em>not</em> rely on Gradescope for providing grading feedback - relying on Gradescope is a very slow feedback loop. To check for linter errors, run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run lint</code> from the terminal. The handout contains the same eslint configuration that is used by our grading script.</p><hr><footer><p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">&copy; 2022-2025 Martin Kellogg, Jonathan Bell, Adeel Bhutta and Mitch Wand.
