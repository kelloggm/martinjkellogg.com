<strong class="label label-red">Due Monday, 22 September 2025, 11:59PM AoE</strong></h2><p>The overall goal of the individual assignment for this semester is to simulate a “starter task” that you might be asked to take on as a junior engineer who is just starting on a new software engineering team. The task has been started for you by one of our senior engineers, and they estimated that completing it would take about one working day (i.e., 8 hours time on task). Unfortunately, that engineer will be out sick for the foreseeable future, so it’s on your to finish their work. Since you’re presumably taking other classes besides CS 490, we’re giving you two weeks for this task. But you should start early: rushing to finish at the last minute will probably lead to lower-quality code. The overall goal is to get you used to the Covey.Town codebase so that you’re ready to be effective during the course project throughout the rest of the semester.</p><details><summary>What's a "senior" engineer?</summary> When someone in industry talks about "senior" engineers, they usually mean "engineers whose judgment is trusted." When you're first hired out of college, you'll (probably) start off as a "junior" engineer, with a senior engineer assigned to mentor you. Usually, junior engineers become senior within a few years. This <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7493290">HackerNews discussion</a> answers this question for you more directly. </details> <details><summary>A note on the accuracy of estimates in software engineering.</summary> As we'll <a href="https://kelloggm.github.io/martinjkellogg.com/teaching/cs490-au25/assets/lecture-process.pdf">discuss later in this class</a>, engineers' estimates of how long an engineering task will take are notoriously variable. If it takes you significantly longer (or shorter) to do the task than our senior engineer's estimate, don't worry! This estimate is here as a rough guide for how long we think this task will take, but it is common for engineers to mis-estimate by an order of magnitude or more, even when they know they might do so. </details><h2 id="objectives-of-this-assignment"> <a href="#objectives-of-this-assignment" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="objectives-of-this-assignment"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Objectives of this assignment</h2><p>The objectives of this assignment are to:</p><ul><li>Get you familiar with the basics of TypeScript, VSCode, and the project codebase<li>Learn how to read and write code in TypeScript<li>Translate high-level requirements into code<li>Learn how to write unit tests with Jest</ul><h2 id="assignment-scenario"> <a href="#assignment-scenario" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="assignment-scenario"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Assignment scenario</h2><p>Covey.Town management has noticed a new trend among users of the Covey.Town’s Tic-Tac-Toe game: discussion of <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/tic">this webcomic</a> which proposes an alternate form of Tic-Tac-Toe. Since the Tic-Tac-Toe game on Covey.Town has historically not produced good engagement metrics (it’s almost like Tic-Tac-Toe is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game">solved game</a>…), your management would like to take advantage of this viral interest by implementing the proposed Tic-Tac-Toe variant in Covey.Town. You’ve been assigned to implement and test this new feature, building on the existing Tic-Tac-Toe functionality.</p><details><summary>Game specification from the webcomic in plaintext</summary> <b>Setup</b><br /> Requires 3 people: 2 players and 1 "monitor"<br /> <br /> Each player has three private tic-tac-toe boards, which their opponent cannot see, but the monitor can. They are labeled A, B, and C.<br /> <br /> There are also 3 public tic-tac-toe boards which everyone can see. These are also labeled A, B, and C.<br /> <br /> <b>Gameplay</b><br /> Players take turns writing one symbol in one square on their private board. Squares that are occupied on a private board are also occupied on the corresponding public board.<br /> <br /> Once a player draws a symbol on their private board, the monitor checks to see if their opponent has already occupied that square by writing a symbol on their private board.<br /> <br /> If the square is already occupied, the player who tried to occupy it a second time loses their turn. The symbol in that occupied square is then drawn in the corresponding square of the public board.<br /> <br /> <b>Scoring</b><br /> Whenever a player gets three in a row on a board, up-down, left-right, or diagonal, they get a point. The winning board is not publicly revealed, but players may no longer play on it.<br /> <br /> <b>Winning</b><br /> Whoever has the most points when no more moves are possible wins. </details><p>In the Covey.Town implementation, which we’re calling “Quantum TicTacToe”, we want to permit two players to play against each other, with Covey.Town itself (i.e., your code) serving as the “monitor”. We hope that this will allow folks chattering about this variant on social media to try it out on Covey.Town (and, we hope they’ll stick around afterwards). Management thought this was high-priority, and so assigned a trusted senior engineer to the project. Unfortunately, that engineer got sick before finishing, so you’ve been asked to step in and finish their work—all the other senior engineers are busy with other important tasks. It’s your job to finish building and testing this feature before we release it.</p><h2 id="getting-started-with-this-assignment"> <a href="#getting-started-with-this-assignment" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="getting-started-with-this-assignment"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Getting started with this assignment</h2><p>The senior engineer who was working on this task has already made a good start: they’ve designed most of the feature, implemented and tested most of the frontend, and stubbed out the backend. Their code is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fall2025-ip1</code> <a href="http://github.com/kelloggm/covey.town/tree/fall2025-ip1">branch</a> of the course staff’s <a href="https://github.com/kelloggm/covey.town">Covey.Town repository</a> that you forked or cloned in <a href="https://kelloggm.github.io/martinjkellogg.com/teaching/cs490-au25/projects/ip0.html">IP0</a>. To get this starter code, you need to fetch this branch. The process differs depending on whether you <em>forked</em> or <em>cloned</em> the starter repository in IP0.</p><details><summary>Can I trust that the senior engineer's code is perfect?</summary> The short answer is "no": you're still expected to exercise good technical judgment, even when working with code written by someone who is more experienced than you. If you find (what you think) is a bug in the starter code, you should fix it: don't treat the starter code as if it is perfect or handed-down from on high. That said, you should probably apply a high standard when trying to decide if the starter code does something correctly: your senior colleague _probably_ knows what they're doing. </details> <details><summary>Forking vs. Cloning</summary> When you <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo">fork</a> a repository, you create a new <b>remote</b> copy (i.e., on GitHub itself) of it that's completely under your control. When you <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">clone</a> a repository, you create a <b>local</b> copy (i.e., just on your computer, not on GitHub). <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/35849">This little article</a> does a good job explaining the difference, if you want more details. </details><h3 id="if-you-forked-our-repository"> <a href="#if-you-forked-our-repository" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="if-you-forked-our-repository"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> If you <strong>forked</strong> our repository</h3><p>You’ll need to “pull from upstream”. Assuming you cloned your own fork, you’ll need to add our fork as a remote (from the folder containing your copy of Covey.Town):</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add course-staff https://github.com/kelloggm/covey.town.git

For example, while you are permitted to modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeGame.ts</code>, you are <strong>not</strong> permitted to modify its existing test suite: that test suite still must pass unmodified. This restriction represents a backwards-compatibility constraint that is common in the real world: you’re allowed to modify code <em>as long as its externally-visible behavior doesn’t change</em>. Note that the list of files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> needs to include everything that you modified; see the submission instructions.</p><h2 id="implementation-tasks"> <a href="#implementation-tasks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="implementation-tasks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Implementation Tasks</h2><p>There are three high-level tasks you need to do:</p><ul><li><strong>Task 1:</strong> implement the backend of the game (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToe.ts</code>) and test it (in<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToe.test.ts</code>). This has barely been started, so this should be the bulk of your work.<li><strong>Task 2:</strong> wire up the backend so that it can handle incoming events (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGameArea.ts</code>). The senior engineer who handed this off to you has written a complete test suite and started it already: you just have to finish it.<li><strong>Task 3:</strong> finish wiring up the frontend and the backend by implementing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_updateFrom</code> method in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeAreaController.ts</code> in the frontend. Your colleague has already written tests for this, as well.</ul><p>We suggest that you complete the tasks in the order presented here, but it’s up to you.</p><h3 id="task-1-quantumtictactoegame-58-points"> <a href="#task-1-quantumtictactoegame-58-points" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="task-1-quantumtictactoegame-58-points"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> <strong>Task 1</strong>: QuantumTicTacToeGame (58 points)</h3><p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGame</code> class extends the base <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Game</code> class. The senior engineer has already defined the relevant types for the game’s state and for moves, which you can find in the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared/types/CoveyTownSocket.d.ts</code>.

The senior engineer working on this project wanted to reuse as much of the existing TicTacToe logic as possible, and that should be one of your goals as well as you finish their work.</p><h4 id="constructor-1-point"> <a href="#constructor-1-point" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="constructor-1-point"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Constructor (1 point)</h4><p>The class needs a constructor that initializes all of its fields.</p><p>Grading:</p><ul><li>constructor implementation passes our tests: 1 point</ul><h4 id="joining-and-leaving-the-game-8-points"> <a href="#joining-and-leaving-the-game-8-points" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="joining-and-leaving-the-game-8-points"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Joining and Leaving the Game (8 points)</h4><p>First, you should implement the basic joining and leaving functionality via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_join()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_leave()</code> methods. You’ll need to manage the “subgames” (A, B, and C) as well as any state that the Quantum game itself needs to manage. The senior engineer wrote a few basic tests for these functions, but you’ll want to write some of your own, as well. We recommend that you look at the implementation of the similarly-named methods in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TicTacToeGame.ts</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Game.ts</code> to get an idea of how these are supposed to work.</p><p>Grading:</p><ul><li>_join implementation passes our tests: 4 points<li>_leave implementation passes our tests: 4 points</ul><h4 id="applying-a-move-core-game-semantics-22-points"> <a href="#applying-a-move-core-game-semantics-22-points" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="applying-a-move-core-game-semantics-22-points"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Applying a Move: Core Game Semantics (22 points)</h4><p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">applyMove</code> method is the core of the game: it needs to take a move and correctly update the corresponding subgame. The senior engineer who was working on this project suggested three helper methods: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_validateMove</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_checkForWins</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_checkForGameEnding</code>, which are stubbed out already. You’ll need to implement these and the rest of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">applyMove</code> itself.</p><p>The senior engineer who was working on the project had also started writing the testing infrastructure for this method before they got sick: they wrote a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeMove</code> method and two simple tests that use it (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGame.test.ts</code>). You’ll want to expand these tests significantly.</p><h4 id="testing-27-points"> <a href="#testing-27-points" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="testing-27-points"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Testing (27 points)</h4><p>There are basic tests for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_join()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_leave()</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">applyMove</code> present, but they aren’t nearly complete enough. You should write test cases as you implement the features above. On the autograder, we will inject a set of 180 bugs into the reference implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGame.ts</code>. For full credit, you test suite must detect at least 167 of these 180 injected bugs.

The main responsibility of this class is to interpet those commands, dispatching them as appropriate to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGame</code> instance that it manages. In this task, you will implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handleCommand</code> method of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGameArea</code>.</p><p>There are three types of commands that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGameArea</code> will receive, which map directly to the three methods of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeGame</code> that you’ve already implemented.</p><p>The senior engineer whose work you’re building on wrote a complete test suite for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handleCommand</code>, so you don’t need to write any additional tests for this class.</p><p>Grading:</p><ul><li>your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handleCommand</code> implementation passes the tests: 12 points</ul><h3 id="task-3-finishing-the-frontend-in-quantumtictactoeareacontroller-20-points"> <a href="#task-3-finishing-the-frontend-in-quantumtictactoeareacontroller-20-points" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="task-3-finishing-the-frontend-in-quantumtictactoeareacontroller-20-points"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> <strong>Task 3:</strong> finishing the frontend in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeAreaController</code> (20 points)</h3><p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_updateFrom</code> method in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeAreaController</code> is responsible for synchronizing the local state of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantumTicTacToeAreaController</code> with a new game state model received from the backend. It orchestrates the updates to the game board’s visual representation and emits events to notify the UI of any changes.</p><p>It needs to:</p><ul><li>call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_updateFrom</code> method from its superclass<li>reconstruct the visible state of the three tic-tac-toe boards (A, B, and C) in the UI based on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newModel</code> it receives from the backend<li>emit events when the board has changed (“boardChanged” event) or when the turn has changed (“turnChanged”), because these have UI effects</ul><p>In essence, this method acts as the bridge between the raw game state from the server and the user-facing representation of the game, ensuring that players only see what they are supposed to see according to the rules of Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe.</p><p>Grading:</p><ul><li>your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_updateFrom</code> method passes the tests: 20 points</ul><h2 id="grading"> <a href="#grading" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="grading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Grading</h2><p>This submission will be scored out of 100 points, 90 of which will be automatically awarded by the grading script, with the remaining 10 manually awarded by the course staff.</p><p>Your code will automatically be evaluated for linter errors and warnings. Submissions that have <em>any</em> linter errors will automatically receive a grade of 0. <strong>Do not wait to run the linter until the last minute</strong>. To check for linter errors, run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run lint</code> from the terminal. The handout contains the same eslint configuration that is used by our grading script.</p><p>Your code will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a test suite that expands on the core tests that are distributed with the starter code. Your tests will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a process that will inject bugs into our reference solution: to receive full marks your tests must detect a minimum number of injected bugs. Each submission will be graded against the same set of injected bugs (repeated submissions will not receive new/different injected bugs). You will <strong>not</strong> receive detailed feedback on which injected bugs you do or do not find.</p><p>The autograding script will impose a strict rate limit of 5 submissions per 24 hours. Submissions that fail to grade will not count against the quota. This limit exists to encourage you to start early on this assignment: students generally report that assignments like this take between 3-20 hours. If you start early, you will be able to take full advantage of the resources that we provide to help you succeed: office hours, discussion on Discord — and the ability to have a greater total number of submission attempts.</p><p>Your code will be manually evaluated for conformance to our course <a href="/martinjkellogg.com/teaching/cs490-au25//policies/style/">style guide</a>. This manual evaluation will account for 10% of your total grade on this assignment. We will manually evaluate your code for style on the following rubric:</p><p>To receive all 10 points:</p><ul><li>All new names (e.g. for local variables, methods, and properties) follow the naming conventions defined in our style guide<li>There are no unused local variables<li>All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) are documented with JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does, as defined in our style guide<li>The code and tests that you write generally follows the design principles discussed in lecture 2. In particular, your design does not have duplicated code that could have been refactored into a shared method.</ul><p>We will review your code and note each violation of this rubric. We will deduct two points for each violation, up to a maximum of deducting all 10 style points.</p><h3 id="submission"> <a href="#submission" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="submission"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Submission</h3><p>Submit your assignment to <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1121276">Gradescope</a>. Please contact the instructors immediately if you have difficulty accessing the course on Gradescope. The course entry code for Gradescope is pinned in the “#ip1-help” channel on Discord.</p><p>To submit your assignment: run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run zip</code> in the top-level directory of Covey.Town. This will produce a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">covey-town.zip</code>. Submit that zip file on Gradescope. Only the list of files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"files"</code> entry in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> will be included in this zip file. If you modified a file that isn’t already listed there, you need to add it to that list before you submit (we’ve listed an overly-conservative set of files that you are <em>might</em> want to modify - no need to worry if you didn’t make any changes to one of the files on the list).</p><p>Gradescope will provide you with feedback on your submission, but note that it will <em>not</em> include any marks that will be assigned after we manually grade your submission for code style (these marks will remain hidden until it is graded). It may take up to 40 minutes for the grading script to complete.</p><p>Gradescope is configured to only provide feedback on at most 5 submissions per-24-hours per-student (submissions that fail to run or receive a grade of 0 are not counted in that limit). We strongly encourage you to lint and test your submission on your local development machine, and <em>not</em> rely on Gradescope for providing grading feedback - relying on Gradescope is a very slow feedback loop. To check for linter errors, run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run lint</code> from the terminal. The starter code contains the same eslint configuration that is used by our grading script.</p><hr><footer><p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">&copy; 2022-2025 Martin Kellogg, Jonathan Bell, Adeel Bhutta and Mitch Wand.
